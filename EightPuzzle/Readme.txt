The puzzle consists of an area divided into a grid, 3 by 3 for the 8-puzzle. On each grid square is a tile, expect for one square which remains empty. Thus, there are eight tiles in the 8-puzzle. A tile that is next to the empty grid square can be moved into the empty space, leaving its previous position empty in turn. Tiles are numbered, 1 thru 8 for the 8-puzzle, so that each tile can be uniquely identified.

The aim of the puzzle is to achieve a given configuration of tiles from a given (different) configuration by sliding the individual tiles around the grid as described above.

The output is a list of moves of the blank tile, "D", "L", "R", "U", Down, Left, Right, Up.

The application contains the Breadth first search solution and the Depth first search solution.
